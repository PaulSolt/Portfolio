# Paul Solt - Portfolio

I am an iOS developer, writer, speaker, and product designer.

I am looking for a new Staff/Senior iOS Developer role where I can improve the customer experience. I enjoy collaborating with Product and Design teams to create new iOS apps and enhance existing experiences. Since 2011, I have published six iOS/macOS apps on the App Store, and I have a popular iOS Development YouTube channel. I am comfortable speaking and presenting to senior leadership and giving technical talks to engineers.

My experience spans tech companies like GoPro, Lambda School, Apple, and Microsoft, as well as iOS/Mac software contracts.

* I understand usability and accessibility. I can make your apps more straightforward and less frustrating to use.
* I break software – I can find and fix bugs you didn't know you had.
* I am incredibly proficient with UIKit, SwiftUI, and Auto Layout — I can implement any design.
* I can quickly mockup, design, and implement new functionality to meet business goals.
* I can translate technical jargon into everyday language for non-technical people.
* I can teach any technical topic and mentor your junior developers.

## Apps

### Brew Coffee

Brew Coffee is a pour-over coffee recipe iOS app for Hario V60 and Chemex. It helps automate the manual process of brewing coffee and improves consistency between brews. I hired designers to help create the initial design that is easy to use. I use Brew Coffee daily, and you can [download the latest beta for Brew Coffee here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/yo3qrfji). It uses Swift with a mix of Storyboard and programmatic layouts.

[Super Easy Timer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/super-easy-timer/id1353137878?ls=1&mt=12) is a productivity Mac app that uses natural language processing to turn "20 minutes" into an active countdown timer. It is quick to start and reset so that users can focus on their tasks. I created the visual design and managed the development with two autistic software interns.
